1. What is Apache Ivy?

Apache Ivy is a tool for managing (recording, tracking, resolving and reporting) 
project dependencies. 
It is characterized by the following:

   1. flexibility and configurability 
        Apache Ivy is essentially process agnostic and is not tied to any 
        methodology or structure. 
        Instead it provides the necessary flexibility and configurability 
        to be adapted to a broad range of dependency management and build 
        processes.
   2. tight integration with Apache Ant
        while available as a standalone tool, Apache Ivy works particularly well 
        with Apache Ant providing a number of powerful Ant tasks ranging 
        from dependency resolution to dependency reporting and publication.

2. Status of this release 

This is the second release candidate of Ivy targetting 2.3.0. 

As a release candidate version, we strongly encourage the use of this version for 
testing and validation. From now on, features are frozen until final 2.3.0 version, 
only bug fixes may be applied before 2.3.0. If no outstanding bugs are reported 
with this release candidate, it will promoted to 2.3.0 about three weeks after this
release candidate.
