Building an OSGi&#153; bundle with standard tools like <tt>javac</tt> and a classpath computed by Apache Ivy&#153; can be erroneous as these tools doesn't take into account the package visibility enforced by the OSGi metadata. Then switching to OSGi dedicated tools like the Eclipse&#153; JTD can be prefered. This kind of tools still need a "target platform", a set of jars against to compile and then later run. A target platform can be easily managed with Ivy and its OSGi capabilities.
