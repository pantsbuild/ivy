With the <a href="../use/install.html">install</a> ant task you are given the possibility to copy ivy descriptors and artifacts found from a resolver and publish them into another resolver.<br/> 

This tutorial will show you how to build your own clean enterprise repository of ivy descriptors and modules artifacts.
We will first use some basic ivy settings files to show how it works, and then we will use advanced features like <a href="../configuration/namespaces.html">namespaces</a> to build a real enterprise repository.

<h1>The project used</h1>
The project that we will use is quite simple.
It is composed of an ant build file, and some ivy settings files.

Here are the accessible target that we will use : 
<div class="shell"><pre>
Z:\ivy-repository>ant -p
Buildfile: build.xml

Main targets:

 advanced                                 --> retrieve files from public repositories (ivyrep, ibiblio, ...) using namespaces
 basic                                    --> retrieve files from well formatted ivy repositories
 basic-deps                               --> retrieve files from well formatted ivy repositories with dependencies
 clean-cache                              --> clean the cache
 clean-repo                               --> clean the destination repository
 commons-lang-1-0-ibiblio-no-namespace    --> retrieve commons-lang 1.0 from ibiblio maven using no namespaces
 commons-lang-1-0-ibiblio-with-namespace  --> retrieve commons-lang 1.0 from ibiblio maven using namespaces
 maven1                                   --> retrieve commons-lang 1.0 from maven1 repo using namespaces
 maven2                                   --> retrieve files from maven2 repo using namespaces
Default target: basic</pre></div>

The project is accessible in the [[svn:src/example/build-a-ivy-repository sources]]
