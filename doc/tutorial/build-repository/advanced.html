Now that you have seen how simple it is to create your own repository from an existing one, you may wonder how you can handle more complex cases, like when the source and destination repositories don't follow the same naming conventions. 


<h1>On the road to a professional repository</h1>
In this section, you will learn how to build a <strong>professional</strong> repository. What is a <strong>professional</strong> repository? Our vision is to say that a good quality repository must follow clear rules about projects naming and must offer correct, useable, configurations and verified project descriptors. In order to achieve those goals, we think that you have to build your own repository.
We have seen in the previous example, that we could use some public repositories to begin to build our own repository. Nevertheless, the result is not always the expected one, especially concerning the naming rules used.

This problem is pretty normal when you have an existing repository, and want to benefit from large public repositories which do not follow the same naming conventions. It also shows up because many public repositories do not use a  consistent naming scheme. For example, why don't all the apache commons modules use the org.apache.commons organization? Well.. for historical reasons. But if you setup your own repository, you may not want to suffer from the mistakes of history.

Fortunately, Ivy has a very powerful answer to this problem: [[settings/namespaces namespaces]].

<h1>Using namespaces</h1>
If you look at the repository built with the [[tutorial/build-repository/basic previous tutorial]], you will see exactly what we were talking about: all apache commons modules use their own name as their organization.

So let's see what Ivy can do using namespaces (we will dig into details later):
<div class="shell"><pre>
[<tutorial/log/install-namespace.txt>]
</pre></div>

Now if we look at our repository, it seems to look fine.
<div class="shell"><pre>
[<tutorial/log/myrepository-content-namespace.txt>]
</pre></div>
We can even have a look at the commons-lang ivy file in our repository:
<div><code type="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ivy-module version="1.0">
	<info organisation="apache"
		module="commons-lang"
		revision="1.0"
		status="integration"
		publication="20051124062021"
		namespace="ibiblio-maven2"
	/>

...
</code></div>
Alright, we see that the organisation is now 'apache'. But where did Ivy pick this up?
<h2>How does this work ?</h2>
Actually, Ivy uses the same repository as before for the source repository, with only one difference: the namespace parameter:
<code type="xml">
<ibiblio name="libraries" 
    root="${ibiblio-maven2-root}" 
    m2compatible="true"
    namespace="maven2"
/>
</code>

A namespace is defined by a set of rules. These rules are based on regular expressions and tell Ivy how to convert data from the repository namespace  to what is called the system namespace, i.e. the namespace in which Ivy runs most of the time (Note: the Ivy cache always uses the system namespace).

For the namespace we call <i>maven2</i>, we have declared several rules. Below is one of the rules:
<h3>rule handling the imported apache maven1 projects</h3>
<code type="xml"><rule>	<!-- imported apache maven1 projects -->
	<fromsystem>
	    <src org="apache" module=".+"/>
	    
	    <dest org="$m0" module="$m0"/>
	</fromsystem>
	<tosystem>
	    <src org="commons-.+" module="commons-.+" />
	    <src org="ant.*" module="ant.*" />
	    ...
	    <src org="xmlrpc" module="xmlrpc" />

	    <dest org="apache" module="$m0"/>
	</tosystem>
</rule></code>
<div class="postit"><u>Note about regular expressions usage :</u>
In order to distinguish matching regular expressions found in organization, module, and revision, the notation Ivy uses prefixes the matching regular expression with the letters 'o', 'm' and 'r'.
$o0 : the whole matching value in the organization attribute
$o1 : the first matching expression group that was marked in the organization attribute
...
The same applies for modules : $m0, $m1, ...
and for revisions : $r0, $r1, ...
</div>
To understand namespaces, 
<ul>
<li><b>fromsystem :</b> we define here that the projects defined in the system namespace under the organization called "apache" are transformed into the destination namespace into projects whose organization is named with the module name, whatever the revision is. For example, the project apache#commons-lang;1.0  in the system namespace will be translated into commons-lang#commons-lang;1.0 in the maven2 resolver namespace.</li>
<li><b>tosystem :</b> we define here the reverse mapping, i.e. how to translate <em>apache</em> projects from maven 2 repo into apache projects in the system namespace. The rule used here tells Ivy that all projects matching <tt>commons-.+</tt> (see it as java regular expression) for their organization name and module name are transformed into projects whose organisation is <tt>apache</tt> with the module name as it was found. The same kind of rule is defined for others apache projects like ant, etc.</li>
</ul>

OK, you should now get the idea behind namespaces, so go ahead and look at the <tt>ivysettings-advanced.xml</tt> file in this example. You can test the installation of a module and its dependencies using namespaces.

Run 
<code>ant maven2-namespace-deps</code> 
and you will see the resulting repository is cleaner than the first one we built.

From our experience, investing in creating a namespace is worth the time it costs if you often need to add new modules or revisions of third party libraries in your own repository, where naming rules already exist or are rather strict. </textarea>
