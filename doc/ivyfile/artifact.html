<b>Tag:</b> artifact <b>Parent:</b> <a href="../ivyfile/publications.html">publications</a>

Declares an artifact published by this module. This is especially useful for other modules dependending on this one. They thus get all published artifacts belonging to the configurations asked. Indeed, each published artifact declares in which public configuration it is published. Thus a module depending on this module only get artifacts marked with the asked configurations, taking into account configurations extension (see <a href="../ivyfile/conf.html">configuration declaration</a>).

The configurations in which an artifact is published can be configured in two ways:
<ul>
<li>conf attribute on artifact element</li>
<li>conf subelement</li>
</ul>
The twos are equivalent, it is only a matter of preference. However, do not mix both for one artifact.

<span class="since">since 1.4</span> The artifact element as default values for all its attributes, so if you want to declare a default artifact you can just declare it like that:<code type="xml">
<artifact />
</code>If this is the only artifact declared, then it's equivalent to having no publication section at all.

<span class="since">since 1.4</span> It is possible to give a url at which artifacts can be found. This is not mandatory, and even not recommended. This is only a convenient way to deal with an existing repository with a bad layout, but should not be avoided in an enterprise repository.

<h1>Examples</h1>
<code type="xml">
<artifact />
</code>
Declares an artifact with the name of the module as name, type and ext jar, and published in all configurations.

<hr />
<code type="xml">
<artifact name="foo-src" type="source" ext="zip" conf="src" />
</code>
Declares an artifact foo-src, of type 'source' with extension 'zip', and published in the src configuration.

<hr />
<code type="xml">
<artifact name="foo" url="http://www.acme.com/repository/barbaz/foo-1.2-bar.jar" />
</code>
Declares an artifact foo, of type and extension 'jar' located at the url http://www.acme.com/repository/barbaz/foo-1.2-bar.jar. This url will only be used if the artifact cannot be found at its standard location.
