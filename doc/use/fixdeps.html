From some resolved dependencies against an ivy.xml, generate another ivy.xml which will have all transitive dependencies declared at the resolved revision.

This task is usefull to always resolve the same set of dependencies. From an ivy.xml where dependencies are declared with ranges and the immediate required modules, <tt>fixdeps</tt> will produce an ivy.xml with all dependencies, with fixed versions, and no more transitive resolve to do.

Nota Bene: this task is not suited to be used in a multi project environement where some dependencies still need to be maintained loose: the one between the projects.

This is a [[ant:postresolvetask post resolve task]], with all the behaviour and attributes common to all post resolve tasks.
