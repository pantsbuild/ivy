The resolve task actually resolve dependencies described in an <a href="../ivyfile.html">ivy file</a>, and put the resolved dependencies in the ivy cache.
If configure has not been called before resolve is called, a default configuration will be used (equivalent to call configure with no attributes).

After the call to this task, four properties are set in ant:
<ul>
<li>ivy.organisation</li>
set to the organisation name found in the ivyfile which was used for resolve
<li>ivy.module</li>
set to the module name found in the ivyfile which was used for resolve
<li>ivy.revision</li>
set to the revision name found in the ivyfile which was used for resolve, or a generated revision name if no revision was specified in the file
<li>ivy.resolved.configurations</li>
set to the comma separated list of configurations resolved
</ul>
<b>Since 1.2:</b>
An additional property is set to true if the resolved dependencies are changes since the last resolve, and to false otherwise: <code>ivy.deps.changed</code>
<b>Since 2.0:</b>
The property ivy.deps.changed will not be set (and not be computed) if you set the parameter <i>checkIfChanged</i> to false. (by default it is true to keep backward compatibility).  This allow to optimize your build when you have multi-module build with multiple configurations.

<b>Since 2.0:</b>
In addition, if the <i>resolveId</i> attribute has been set, the following properties are set as well:
<ul>
<li>ivy.organisation.${resolveId}</li>
<li>ivy.module.${resolveId}</li>
<li>ivy.revision.${resolveId}</li>
<li>ivy.resolved.configurations.${resolveId}</li>
<li>ivy.deps.changed.${resolveId}</li>
</ul>

<b>Since 2.4</b>
If current module extends other modules 
<ul>
<li>ivy.parents.count</li>
number of parents module
<li>ivy.parent[index].organisation</li>
set to the organisation name found in the parent ivyfile which was used for resolve
<li>ivy.parent[index].module</li>
set to the module name found in the parent ivyfile which was used for resolve
<li>ivy.parent[index].revision</li>
set to the revision name found in the parent ivyfile which was used for resolve
<li>ivy.parent[index].branch</li>
set to the branch name found in the parent ivyfile which was used for resolve
</ul>
Where <i>index</i> represent the index of extends module.

When ivy has finished the resolve task, it outputs a summary of what has been resolved. This summary looks like this:
<pre>
---------------------------------------------------------------------
|                  |            modules            ||   artifacts   |
|       conf       | number| search|dwnlded|evicted|| number|dwnlded|
---------------------------------------------------------------------
|      default     |   4   |   0   |   0   |   0   ||   4   |   0   |
---------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
This table gives some statistics about the dependency resolution. Each line correspond to a configuration resolved. Then the table is divided in two parts:
<ul>
<li>modules</li>
<ul>
<li>number</li>
This is the total number of dependency modules resolved in this configuration, including transitive ones
<li>search</li>
This is the number of dependency modules that required a repository access. The repository access is needed if the module is not yet in cache, or if a latest version is required, or in some other cases (depending on checkModified, for instance)
<li>dwnlded</li>
This is the number of dependency ivy files downloaded from the repository. This number can be less than the total number of modules even with a clean cache, if no ivy file is provided for some dependencies.
<li>evicted</li>
This is the number of dependency module evicted by conflict managers.
</ul>
<li>artifacts</li>
<ul>
<li>number</li>
This is the total number of artifacts resolved in the given configuration.
<li>dwnlded</li>
This is the number of artifacts actually downloaded from the repository.
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Inline mode</h2>
<span class="since">since 1.4</span> The inline mode allow to call a resolve without an ivy file, by setting directly the module which should be resolved from the repository. It is particularly useful to install released software, like an ant task for example. When inline is set to true, the organisation module and revision attributes are used to specify which module should be resolved from the repository. 

<b>Remark:</b> if you want the standard ivy properties to be set or to reuse the results of an inline resolve by other post-resolve tasks like retrieve, cachepath, report, ..., you must set the keep attribute to true!

<h2>Resolve mode</h2>
<span class="since">since 2.0</span> The resolve mode allows to define how Ivy should use dependency revision constraints when performing the resolution.

Two modes are available:
<ul>
<li>default</li> In this mode the default revision constraint (expressed with the rev attribute in the [[ivyfile/dependency]] element) is used.
<li>dynamic</li> In this mode the dynamic revision constraint (expressed with the revConstraint attribute in the [[ivyfile/dependency]] element) is used.
</ul>

<h2>Concurrency</h2>
During resolve, Ivy creates a file in the [[settings/caches resolution cache]]. The creation of this file is not aimed to support concurrency, meaning that you can't have two concurrent resolve of the same module, in the same resolution cache, with the same resolveId. 

<i>Note for developers:
After the call to this task, a reference to the module descriptor resolved is put in the ant project under the id <code>"ivy.resolved.descriptor"</code>.</i>

<h1>Child elements</h1>

<b><i>(Since 2.3)</i></b>

These child elements are defining an inlined ivy.xml's <a href="../ivyfile/dependencies.html">dependencies</a> elements. Thus these child elements cannot be used together with the <i>inline</i> or <i>file</i> attributes.
There is one important difference with the ivy.xml's <a href="../ivyfile/dependencies.html">dependencies</a>: there is no master configuration to handle here. There is actually only one, the one on which the resolve will run. So every attribute in <a href="../ivyfile/dependency.html">dependency</a>, <a href="../ivyfile/exclude.html">exclude</a>,  <a href="../ivyfile/override.html">override</a> or <a href="../ivyfile/conflict.html">conflict</a> which is about a master configuration is not supported. And every attribute about a mapping of a master configuration on a dependency configuration is now expecting only the dependency configuration.
