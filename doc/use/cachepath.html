Constructs an ant path consisting of artifacts in ivy cache (or origin location with depending on useOrigin setting) for a resolved module configuration.

This is a [[ant:postresolvetask post resolve task]], with all the behaviour and attributes common to all post resolve tasks.

Please prefer the use of retrieve + standard ant path creation, which make your build more independent from ivy (once artifacts are properly retrieved, ivy is not required any more).

Built path is registered in ant with a given id, and can thus be used like any other ant path using refid.

<span class="since">since 1.4</span> The behaviour is like this when 'useOrigin=true':
<ul>
<li>if the artifact is not local, the location from within the cache is used</li>
<li>if the artifact is a local artifact, it's original location is used</li>
</ul>
Note that if resolve has been called separately, the copy to the cache may have occur normally if useOrigin was not set when calling [[ant:resolve]]. If resolve has not been called, it will be called automatically with useOrigin set to the value specified on this task.

<h1>Examples</h1>
<code type="xml">
<cachepath pathid="default.classpath" conf="default" />
</code>
Construct an ant path composed of all artifacts being part of the default configuration obtained through the last resolve call.

<hr/>

<code type="xml">
<cachepath pathid="default.classpath" conf="default" useOrigin="true" />
</code>
Same as before but will use the original location for local artifacts, and the cache location for other artifacts.

<hr/>

<code type="xml">
<ivy:cachepath organisation="emma" module="emma" revision="2.0.4217" inline="true" conf="ant" pathid="emma.classpath"/>
<taskdef resource="emma_ant.properties" classpathref="emma.classpath" /> 
</code>
Resolves the emma module in version 2.0.4217, constructs an ant path with the corresponding artifacts, and then define the emma tasks using this path.
