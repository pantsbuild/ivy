<h2>Announcement</h2>

<pre>
Mar 30, 2009 - The Ivy project is pleased to announce its 2.1.0-rc1 release.
This is the first candidate release of Ivy 2.1.0.

Ivy is a tool for managing (recording, tracking, resolving and
reporting) project dependencies, characterized by flexibility,
configurability, and tight integration with Apache Ant.

This is a release candidate for 2.1.0 final, meaning that no changes 
except bug fixes will occur between this release candidate and 2.1.0 final.
Problems found at this phase can be fixed in the final release, so now 
is a good time to download and use it. If no outstanding bugs are reported
in the coming weeks, this release candidate will be promoted as the 2.1.0 
final release.

Key features of the 2.1.0 release are
* enhanced Maven2 compatibility, with several bug fixes and more
  pom features covered
* new options for the Ivy Ant tasks and commandline
* numerous bug fixes as documented in Jira and in the release notes

We encourage all users of Ivy to update to this new version.

Issues should be reported to:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IVY

Download the 2.1.0-rc1 release at:

<h3>1. What is Apache Ivy?</h3>

Apache Ivy is a tool for managing (recording, tracking, resolving and reporting) 
project dependencies. 
It is characterized by the following:

   1. flexibility and configurability 
   		Apache Ivy is essentially process agnostic and is not tied to any 
   		methodology or structure. 
   		Instead it provides the necessary flexibility and configurability 
   		to be adapted to a broad range of dependency management and build 
   		processes.
   2. tight integration with Apache Ant
   		while available as a standalone tool, Apache Ivy works particularly well 
   		with Apache Ant providing a number of powerful Ant tasks ranging 
   		from dependency resolution to dependency reporting and publication.

<h3>2. Status of this release</h3>

This is the first release candidate of Ivy targetting 2.1.0. 

As a release candidate version, we strongly encourage the use of this version for 
testing and validation. From now on, features are frozen until final 2.1.0 version, 
only bug fixes may be applied before 2.1.0. If no outstanding bugs are reported 
with this release candidate, it will promoted to 2.1.0 about two weeks after this
release candidate.
