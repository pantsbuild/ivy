<h3>1. What is Apache Ivy?</h3>

Apache Ivy is a tool for managing (recording, tracking, resolving and reporting) 
project dependencies. 
It is characterized by the following:

   1. flexibility and configurability 
   		Apache Ivy is essentially process agnostic and is not tied to any 
   		methodology or structure. 
   		Instead it provides the necessary flexibility and configurability 
   		to be adapted to a broad range of dependency management and build 
   		processes.
   2. tight integration with Apache Ant
   		while available as a standalone tool, Apache Ivy works particularly well 
   		with Apache Ant providing a number of powerful Ant tasks ranging 
   		from dependency resolution to dependency reporting and publication.

<h3>2. Status of this release </h3>

This is the first release of Ivy since it has graduated as a sub project of Apache Ant. 
As a beta version, we encourage the use of this version for testing and validation.
Still API and features are still likely to change until final 2.0.0 version. 

The current production quality version is still 1.4.1, which has not been produced 
within the Apache Software Foundation.

<h3>3. Major Changes in this Release</h3>

This section describes what has changed between version 1.4.1 and this version of Apache Ivy.

This new version of Apache Ivy is almost fully compatible with previous versions as long as you do not use custom plugins: Ivy API has changed, but not its behavior.

Some tasks and configuration elements have been renamed, but the old versions
are still available, they are only deprecated (you will see deprecated warnings). 

<h4>3.1. Java Package Name Changes</h4>

All of the Ivy Java package names have changed in Apache Ivy. They now start 
with org.apache rather than fr.jayasoft. There have been other changes as well. 
Important refactorings have done on the source code to ease the understanding
of Ivy internal architecture by new developers.

A class named org.apache.ivy.Ivy14 is provided with an API compatible with the
fr.jayasoft.Ivy class of Ivy 1.4.1, to ease migration to this new version.

<h4>3.2. Configuration replaced by Settings</h4>

Configuration used to have two meanings in prior Ivy versions, causing some confusion with new users.
To avoid this confusion, Apache Ivy calls settings instead of configuration the files used to customize Ivy. Configuration is still used for module configurations.

Besides the changes in the documentation, this renaming also imply a modification in settings files, which now use ivysettings as root element instead of ivyconf, and settings instead of conf element to define top level defaults (such as defaultCache, ...).
Previous names have been deprecated, so previous settings files can still be used, but you will see a deprecation warning.

<h4>3.3. Review of settings loading</h4>

This new Ivy version experience with a new way of loading the settings. The configure task is deprecated, and replaced by a settings datatype. By using the settings datatype, you can easily use several settings inside one Ant build script, and use a scope to tell Ivy which settings to use when calling a task which requires some settings.

This is still an experiment though, so feedback is very welcome in the mailing lists.

<h4>3.4. Public resolver in default settings is now ibiblio in m2 compatible mode</h4>

In previous versions Ivy used to use the ivyrep resolver as default public resolver, but ivyrep is no longer maintained, while maven 2 repository on ibiblio is growing rapidly.

Since Ivy is compatible with maven 2 repository, defaulting to the ibiblio maven 2 repository makes more sense.

If you have any issue of backward compatibility with these new settings, you can simply set the following ant property before loading the settings (implicitly or explicitly):
ivy.14.compatible=true

<h4>3.5. Relative paths resolution</h4>

Relative paths resolution in Ivy used to be resolved against the current directory. 
Some work is in progress in this area, currently relative path resolution for the inclusion of configuration files in Ivy files has been modified to work relative to the Ivy file in which the configurations are included.

This may break your dependency resolution if you used to use relative paths for configuration file inclusion.

<h4>3.6 Ivyrep ivyroot attribute is now mandatory</h4>

If you still use the ivyrep resolver, you will need to provide an ivyroot.
To restore the previous behavior, use ivyroot="http://ivyrep.jayasoft.org/".

Since Ivyrep is not maintained anymore, we recommend moving away from this repository anyway.

<h3>4. Migrating from Jayasoft Ivy to Apache Ivy</h3>

Apache Ivy is fully compatible with Jayasoft Ivy as long as you do not use 
custom plugins.
This means that you can use Apache Ivy as a drop in replacement of Jayasoft Ivy.

However due to the the renaming of configuration files to settings files, we
strongly suggest to update your configuration files:
- rename the files called ivyconf*.xml in ivysettings*.xml
- rename 'ivyconf' element in 'ivysettings'
- rename 'conf' element of those settings file in 'settings'

We also suggest using the new org.apache.ivy.ant package name for the antlib declaration.

Migrating custom plugins can be done by using the org.apache.ivy.Ivy14 class
instead of fr.jayasoft.ivy.Ivy, and reorganizing your imports to reflect the 
changes in the package names.

<h3>5. How to Get Involved</h3>

The Apache Ivy project really needs and appreciates any contributions, 
including documentation help, source code and feedback.  If you are interested
in contributing, please visit http://ant.apache.org/ivy/get-involved.html.

<h3>6. How to Report Issues</h3>

The Apache Ivy project uses JIRA for issue tracking.  Please report any 
issues you find at http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IVY

Since this is our first release as a subproject of Ant, we'd also like to take this opportunity to thank the Apache Ant project for accepting Ivy as a subproject, the Apache Incubator community for their guidance to behave the "Apache way", and our mentors Antoine Levy-Lambert, Stephane Bailliez, Steve Loughran and Stefan Bodewig for their precious time and help during the incubation process.
