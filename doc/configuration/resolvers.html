<b>Tag:</b> resolvers

Defines a list of dependency resolvers usable in ivy. Each dependency resolver is identified by its name, given as an attribute.

The child tag used for the dependency resolver must be equal to a name of a dependency resolver type (either built-in or added with the typedef tag).

<span class="since">since 1.3</span> Once defined, resolvers can be referenced by their name, using the following syntax:
<code type="xml">
<resolver ref="alreadydefinedresolver"/>
</code>
Note that this works only if the resolver has been already defined, and not if it is defined later in the ivysettings file.
<h1>Child elements</h1>

<h1>Built-in Resolvers</h1>
Ivy comes with a set of built-in dependency resolvers able to answer to the most common needs. 

If you don't find the one you want here, you can also check if some one has not contributed it in the [[links links page]], or even <a href="../extend.html">write your own</a>.

There are basically two types of resolver in Ivy: composite and standard resolvers. A composite resolver is a resolver which delegates the work to other resolvers. The other resolvers are standard resolvers.

Here is the list of built-in resolvers:

<table class="ivy-attributes">
<thead>
    <tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><a href="../resolver/ivyrep.html">IvyRep</a></td><td>Standard</td><td>Finds ivy files on ivyrep and artifacts on ibiblio.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../resolver/ibiblio.html">IBiblio</a></td><td>Standard</td><td>Finds artifacts on ibiblio.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../resolver/filesystem.html">FileSystem</a></td><td>Standard</td><td>This very performant resolver finds ivy files and artifacts in your file system.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../resolver/url.html">Url</a></td><td>Standard</td><td>Finds ivy files and artifacts in any repository accessible with urls.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../resolver/vfs.html">Vfs</a></td><td>Standard</td><td>Finds ivy files and artifacts in any repository accessible with <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/vfs/">apache commons vfs</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../resolver/ssh.html">ssh</a></td><td>Standard</td><td>Finds ivy files and artifacts in any repository accessible with ssh.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../resolver/sftp.html">sftp</a></td><td>Standard</td><td>Finds ivy files and artifacts in any repository accessible with sftp.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../resolver/chain.html">Chain</a></td><td>Composite</td><td>Delegates the finding to a chain of sub resolvers.</td></tr>

</code>
Defines a filesystem resolver, named '1', which is then used in two chains, the first which seconds the filesystem resolver with an ivyrep resolver, and second which seconds the filesystem resolver with an ibiblio resolver, and which returns the first module found, and uses the whole chain to download artifacts (see corresponding resolvers documentation for details about them).   Resolver 1 will use a cache named 'cache-1' which should have been defined under the caches element.
