<h1>Making a release</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
Requirements for making a release are similar to the requirements for building from source, except that sun jdk 1.6 and ant 1.7 are required.
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<h3>1. Check the files which needs to be updated for the release.</h3>
On the trunk, check that files which require update for the release are up to date.
This includes particularly:
RELEASE_NOTES
CHANGES
README
<h3>2. Create a release branch</h3>
This will allow to work separately from other developers, in case you need any last modification.
<code>
svn copy https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/core/trunk \
           https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/core/branches/2.0.0-beta1 \
      -m "Creating a release branch for 2.0.0-beta1."
</code>
<h3>3. Check out the branch</h3>
<code>
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/core/branches/2.0.0-beta1 ivy-2.0.0-beta1
</code>
<h3>4. Add Ivy xsd file.</h3>
You need to store the current ivy xml schema in the documentation, so that it will later be accessible on public web site. To do so, run the following command in the directory in which you checked out the release branch:
<code>
ant -f build-release.xml release-xsd
</code>

<h3>5. Add release note page in the documentation.</h3>
Open the file doc/index.html with your favorite browser, and click on the plus button in the upper right. Choose "Release Notes" as title, and "release-notes" as page id. 

Then edit the page (hit the first button at the upper right), and copy the content of the RELEASE_NOTES file.

You can also add the announcement for the release if it's already ready. If this is an incubator version, add the usual incubator disclaimer too.

Move the page up in the TOC using the arrow button in the toolbar at the upper right, so that it's the first child page under the "Documentation" page.

If you take the time to make the content of the release notes more "xooki compliant" (by removing unnecessary end of lines and adding h2 h3 and h4 tags), the page could then look like something like that:
http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.0.0-alpha-1.html

<h3>6. Commit your changes</h3>
<code>
svn status
svn add doc/ivy.xsd
svn add doc/release-notes.html
svn ci -m "update templates, add release notes and ivy.xsd in documentation."
</code>
<h3>7. Check that you have no pending modifications</h3>
<code>
svn status
</code>
If your working copy is clean, you can launch the release script. If it isn't, make sure to clean it properly. Sometimes you may need to call ant clean-all if you have started to work with ant builds. If you are confused about your working copy state, delete it and check it out again.
<h3>8. Launch the release script</h3>
<code>
ant -f build-release.xml release
</code>
The status should be release only for final releases, and milestone for any other intermediate release.
If anything is wrong, fix and go back to step 4.
If the release script is successful, release artifacts will be waiting for you in the build/distrib directory.
<h3>9. Verify the release</h3>
Check that all zips can be opened correctly, and that running 'ant' after unzipping the source distribution works properly.
You can also do a smoke test with the generated ivy.jar , to see if it is able to resolve properly a basic module (for instance you can run some tutorials provided in the src/example directory in all distributions).
<h3>10. Sign and upload the artifacts</h3>
It's now time to sign the release artifacts and upload them to a location accessible by other Apache commiters.

Here is a simple way to sign the files using gnupg:
<code>
gpg --armor --output file.zip.asc --detach-sig file.zip
</code>

Here is a ruby script you can use to sign the files:
<code>
require 'find'

Find.find('build/distrib') do |f| 
    `gpg --armor --output #{f}.asc --detach-sig #{f}` if File.file?(f) && ['.zip', '.gz', '.jar', '.pom'].include?(File.extname(f))
end
</code>
Be prepared to enter your passphrase several times if you use this script, gpg will ask for your passphrase for each file to sign.

When you're done upload the content of the distrib directory to a publicly accessible web site, your apache personal site being a good location for this. Make sure you include some kind of disclaimer somewhere to inform people the release is not approved yet.

You can for example add a HEADER.html like this:
<code>
<h2>WARNING: files available here are NOT an Apache approved release yet.</h2>
</code>

<h3>11. Prepare the Eclipse update site</h3>

To be able to test the release within IvyDE, it can be deployed in the IvyDE update site. See <a href="updatesite.html">that page</a> to know how to process.

<h3>12. Tag the svn repository</h3>
As soon as you are happy with the artifacts to be released, it is time to tag the svn repo
<code>
svn copy https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/core/branches/2.0.0-beta1 \
           https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/core/tags/2.0.0-beta1 \
      -m "Tag release 2.0.0-beta1."
</code>

<h3>13. Call for a vote to approve the release</h3>
Cast a vote to approve the release on the dev@ant.apache.org mailing list.

Here is an example:
<code>
Subject: [VOTE] Ivy ${version} Release

I have built a release candidate for Ivy ${version}

You can download it from this URL: ${url}

Do you vote for the release of these binaries?

[ ] Yes
[ ] No

Regards,

${me}, Ivy ${version} release manager
</code>
<h3>14. Upload to public repository</h3>
If the release is approved, it's now time to make it public by uploading it to the public Apache distrib repository (i.e. /www/www.apache.org/dist/ant/ivy/[version] on people.a.o).

Copy also the staging maven 2 repository to apache maven 2 rsync repo:
/www/people.apache.org/repo/m2-ibiblio-rsync-repository

<h3>15. Update the web site</h3>
Add a link to the released version documentation in the web site. 

To do so, you need to:
<ol>
<li>add a svn externals reference to the documentation</li>
edit the svn properties of site/history, and in the svn:externals property, add a line like this one:
<code>
2.0.0-beta1 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/core/branches/2.0.0-beta1/doc
</code>
You can also change the latest-milestone and/or latest-release if necessary.

You can use "svn propedit svn:externals path/to/history" to do so.

Once you've changed the property, use "svn up" to checkout the proper documentation.
<li>edit the toc.json file in the site component of Ivy</li>
and add something like that:
<code>
{
   "title":"2.0.0-beta1",
   "importRoot":"history/2.0.0-beta1",
   "importNode":"index"      
}
</code>
You can also edit the title of the main documentation node pointing to latest-milestone / latest-release if necessary.

<li>Add a call to init-imported-version in site/build.xml</li>
In the init-imported-history target, add a task call like this one:
<code>
<init-imported-version version="2.0.0-beta1" />
</code>
</ol>
Then launch "ant init-imported-history" in the site directory, and check the documentation now has the released version in the history, and that this documentation can be accessed with no problem with a unified TOC.

Then you can update the release notes page of the imported documentation if necessary, to include the announcement for example.

It's time to update the download image used on the home page and the download page. Use site/images/ivy-dl.xcf as a basis if you have <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">gimp</a> installed. Then you can update the home page to refer to this image, and add a news item announcing the new version. Update also the download page with the new image and update the links to the download location (using a search/replace on the html source is recommended for this).

You are now ready to commit your changes (make sure to commit changes in imported locations too), and update the online site:
<code>
ant clean publish-site
</code>

<h3>16. Deploy the Eclipse updatesite</h3>

If the Eclipse update site has already been prepared to include that new Ivy release, it is now needed to be deployed. Then follow the deployment instruction on <a href="updatesite.html">that page</a>.

<h3>17. Announce</h3>
Announce the release on the dev@ant.a.o, ivy-user@ant.a.o, user@ant.apache.org and announce@apache.org mailing lists.
You can also announce the release on popular web sites, like freshmeat.net (xavier is the owner of the Ivy project on freshmeat), javalobby.org, theserverside.com, dzone.com, ...
<h3>16. Update this doc</h3>
If you feel like anything is missing or misleading in this release doc, update it as soon as you encounter the problem.
<h3>17. Merge your modifications back to the trunk if necessary.</h3>
Modifications on the template files do not need to be merged, but if you had troubles during your release you may want to merge your fixes back to the trunk.
<h3>18. Prepare next release</h3>
Update the file version.properties with the version of the next release so that anyone building from the trunk will obtain jar with the correct version number.

Release the version in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IVY">jira</a>, and create a new unreleased version for the next planned version.</textarea>
