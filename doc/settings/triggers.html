<b>Tag:</b> triggers
<span class="since">since 1.4</span>

<span class="tagdoc" id="ivysettings.triggers">Defines a list of triggers to activate on some Ivy events.</span>

A trigger is an action which is performed whenever a particular event occurs.
Ivy supports 3 type of triggers out of the box: 
<ul>
<li>ant-call</li> calls a target in the same build as the original one whenever a particular event occurs. 
<li>ant-build</li> calls an ant build which may be in another ant build script. 
<li>log</li> echo a message, usually in a file
</ul>

If you want to use a different trigger, you can <a href="../extend.html">implement your own</a>.

The following events are available in Ivy:
<table class="ivy-children">

The child tag used for the dependency resolver must be equal to a name of a trigger type (either built-in or added with the typedef tag).

<h1>Child elements</h1>
<table class="ivy-children">
<thead>
    <tr><th class="ivy-chld">Element</th><th class="ivy-chld-desc">Description</th><th class="ivy-chld-card">Cardinality</th></tr>

<h1>Built-in Triggers</h1>
Ivy comes with 3 built-in triggers: 

<table class="ivy-attributes">
<thead>
    <tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>ant-build</td><td>Triggers an ant build. Note that by default the ant build is triggered only once per build file, the property onlyonce can be set to false to change this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ant-call</td><td>Calls a target in the current ant build.</td></tr>
<tr><td>log</td><td>Logs a message on the console or in a log file.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<h1><a name="common">Common attributes</a></h1>
All triggers share some common attributes detailed here.

Among these attributes, you will find how to select when the trigger should be performed. You have to provide an event name, which is simple, but you can also use a filter expression. The syntax for this expression is very simple and limited: 
you can use the = operator to compare an attribute (left operande) with a value (right operande).
you can use AND OR NOT as boolean operators
you cannot use parenthesis to change the precedence

<table class="ivy-attributes">
<thead>
    <tr><th class="ivy-att">Attribute</th><th class="ivy-att-desc">Description</th><th class="ivy-att-req">Required</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr><td>name</td><td>the name of the trigger for identification purpose only</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>event</td><td>the name of the event on which the trigger should be performed</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>filter</td><td>a filter expression used to restrict when the trigger should be performed</td>

<h1>Examples</h1>
<code type="xml">
<triggers>
    <ant-build antfile="${ivy.settings.dir}/[module]/build.xml" target="publish"
           event="pre-resolve-dependency" filter="revision=latest.integration"/>
</triggers>
</code>
Triggers an ant build of the ant file ${ivy.settings.dir}/[module]/build.xml (where [module] is replaced by the name of the dependency resolved) with the target "publish", just before resolving a dependency with a latest.integration revision.
Note that by default the ant build is triggered only once per build file. See below to see how to trigger the build more than once.
<hr/>
<code type="xml">
<triggers>
    <ant-build antfile="${ivy.settings.dir}/[module]/build.xml" target="publish"
           event="pre-resolve-dependency" filter="revision=latest.integration"
           onlyonce="false" />
</triggers>
</code>
Same as before, but this time the builds will be triggered as many time as the dependency is resolved, instead of only once.
<hr/>
<code type="xml">
<triggers>
    <ant-call target="unzip" prefix="dep"
          event="post-download-artifact" filter="type=zip AND status=successful"/>
</triggers>
</code>
Triggers an ant call of the target unzip just after downloading a zip artifact, prefixing all parameters to the target with 'dep'.
Here is how the target can look like:
<code type="xml">
<target name="unzip">
     <echo>
        unzipping artifact: 
        organisation=${dep.organisation} 
        module=${dep.module} 
        revision=${dep.revision}
        artifact=${dep.artifact}
        type=${dep.type}
        ext=${dep.ext}
        origin=${dep.origin}
        local=${dep.local}
        size=${dep.size}
        file=${dep.file}
     </echo>
     <mkdir dir="${basedir}/out"/>
     <unzip src="${dep.file}" dest="${basedir}/out"/>
</target>
</code>
<hr/>
<code type="xml">
<triggers>
    <log file="ivy.log" 
          message='downloaded "${origin}" to "${file}" (${duration}ms - ${size}B)'
          event="post-download-artifact" filter="status=successful"/>
</triggers>
</code>
Logs any successful artifact download, with information on the source and destination, and details on download size and duration.

The file attribute is optional, the log trigger will output messages to console if it isn't provided.</textarea>
