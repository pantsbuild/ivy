<b>Tag:</b> modules

Defines per module or module set settings.

The rules are given by defining a module set, using pattern for module organisation and name, and giving some settings for the set, like the name of the corresponding resolver to use.

If no rule match a given module, the default setting will be used.

Even if not required, because the use of a default big resolver (chain, for instance) able to resolve all dependencies can answer all the needs, the configuration of smaller resolvers used for different cases can improve performances a lot. For instance, if you have a local repository for your modules and a distant repository for third party libraries, it is a good idea to have two separate resolvers, and configure ivy to use one for all your modules and another for the rest (the default one).
