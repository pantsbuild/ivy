<b>Tag:</b> include

The included ivysettings file has to be a complete well formed ivysettings file, i.e. it does have to include the <code><ivysettings></code> tag.

<h1>Attributes</h1>
<table class="ivy-attributes">
<thead>
    <tr><th class="ivy-att">Attribute</th><th class="ivy-att-desc">Description</th><th class="ivy-att-req">Required</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr><td>url</td><td>a URL to the ivysettings file to include</td>
        <td>Yes, unless file is specified</td></tr>
    <tr><td>file</td><td>a path to the ivysettings file to include</td>
        <td>Yes, unless url is specified</td></tr>
    <tr><td>optional</td><td>indicates whether Ivy should throw an error if the specified file doesn't exist. <span class="since">(Since 2.4)</span>.</td>
        <td>No, default to false</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<code type="xml">
<ivysettings>
  <property name="myrepository" value="path/to/my/real/rep"/>
  <settings defaultResolver="default"/>
  <include file="path/to/ivysettings-default.xml"/>
</ivysettings>
</code>
with ivysettings-default.xml:
<code type="xml">
<ivysettings>
  <property name="myrepository" value="path/to/rep" overwrite="false"/>
  <resolvers>
    <ivyrep name="default" ivyroot="${myrepository}"/>
  </resolvers>
</ivysettings>
</code>

The included ivysettings defines a resolver named default, which is an ivyrep resolver, with its root configured as being the value of myrepository variable. This variable is given the value path/to/rep in the included file, but because the attribute overwrite is set to false, it will not override the value given in the main ivysettings including this one, so the value used for myrepository will be path/to/my/real/rep.
<hr/>
<code type="xml">
<ivysettings>
  <include file="ivysettings-macro.xml"/>
  <resolvers>
    <mymacro name="includeworks" mymainrep="included/myrep" mysecondrep="included/secondrep"/>
  </resolvers>
</ivysettings> 
</code>
with ivysettings-macro.xml being the ivysettings example given on the [[settings/macrodef macrodef documentation page]].
This lets us easily reuse the custom macro resolver.
