<b>Tag:</b> cache

<span class="since">Since 2.0</span>.

<span class="tagdoc" id="ivysettings.caches.cache">Defines a repository cache instance based on the default repository cache implementation.</span>

The default repository cache implementation caches files on the local filesystem in subdirectories of a configured base directory.

By default also, the parsed module descriptor read from the cache are kept in a memory cache in case they are reused.  This may enhance the performance of multi-module build, provided that all modules are build using the same ivy instance.  The size of this memory cache is configurable in term of number of module descriptors.  A size of 0 means no memory caching.

    <tr><td>useOrigin</td><td>true to avoid the copy of local artifacts to the cache and use directly their original location, false otherwise. 
To know if an artifact is local ivy asks to the resolver. Only filesystem resolver is considered local by default, but this can be disabled if you want to force the copy on one filesystem resolver and use the original location on another. Note that it is safe to use useOrigin even if you use the cache for some non local resolvers. In this case the cache will behave as usual, copying files to the cache. Note also that this only applies to artifacts, not to ivy files, which are still copied in the cache.</td>

<cache name="mycache" 
       basedir="/path/to/mycache"
       ivyPattern="[module]/ivy-[revision].xml" 
       artifactPattern="[module]/[artifact]-[revision].[ext]"
       lockStrategy="no-lock"
       defaultTTL="1s">

    <ttl organisation="org1" duration="10m 20s" />
    <ttl organisation="org2" duration="5h" />
    <ttl organisation="org3" duration="2d 12h" />
</cache>
</code>
Defines a cache called 'mycache', storing files in the '/path/to/mycache' directory using '[module]/ivy-[revision].xml' as pattern to store Ivy files and '[module]/[artifact]-[revision].[ext]' as pattern to store other artifacts.
The lock strategy used by this cache is the 'no-lock' strategy, which does not perform any locking. 
The defaultTTL used is of 1s, meaning that by default dynamic revision result will be stored and used for one second. TTL rules then define that all 'latest.integration' revisions will be stored and used for 200ms, while other dynamic revisions from org1 org2 and org3 modules will be stored respectively for 10 minutes 20 seconds; 5 hours; and 2 days and 12 hours.</textarea>
