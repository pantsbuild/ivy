This resolver uses the file system to resolve ivy files and artifacts. It presents the advantage to usually have very good performances. Moreover, it is easy to setup using basic OS file sharing mechanism.

The configuration of such a resolver is mainly done through ivy and artifact patterns, indicating where ivy files and artifacts can be found in the file system. You can indicate a list of pattern which will be checked one after the other.

<span class="since">since 1.3</span> Using the m2compatible attribute, this resolver will convert dots found in organisation in slashes like maven2 does for groupId. For instance, it will transform the organisation from 'com.company' into 'com/company' when replacing the token [organisation] in your pattern.

<h1>Attributes</h1>
This resolver shares the <a href="../configuration/resolvers.html#common">common attributes</a> of standard resolvers.
